This is a prompt for an Android app development assignment. 📳  

This is a prompt for an Android app development assignment. The app is a quiz game where users match names and photos. The app should have three core activities: a "database" activity that shows all names and pictures and allows the user to add, remove, and sort entries, a "quiz" activity that randomly selects a photo and presents the correct name and two wrong names, and an "add entry" activity where the user can add new photos and names to the database. The main menu should have a switch for easy or hard mode, and the app should keep track of the score in the quiz activity. The instructions also mention to not immediately use a fancy database and to use a simple data structure from the Collections interface, and to add 2 or 3 photos and names to the app through the resource folder. The code should be submitted as a link to a Git repository, and the instructions also mention to use Git properly, document the code, and make sure navigating back from an activity works correctly.
