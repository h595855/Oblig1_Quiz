This is a prompt for an Android app development assignment. 📳  

The app is a quiz game where users match names and photos
 The app should have three core activities:
 
 a "database" activity that shows all names and pictures and allows the user to add, remove, and sort entries. 🖥
 
 a "quiz" activity that randomly selects a photo and presents the correct name and two wrong names, 🕹
 
 an "add entry" activity where the user can add new photos and names to the database. ➕
 
 The main menu should have a switch for easy or hard mode, and the app should keep track of the score in the quiz activity.
 
 Now featuring DATABASE technologies.
 
 implementing data storage using Android Room DAOs to save user data and ensure that it is not lost when the app is restarted.
 
 The third task involves writing test cases using Espresso for the app. 
 
 At least three test cases are required, including one that checks if the correct button is clicked to take the user to the right sub-activity,
 
 The instructions also mention to not immediately use a fancy database and to use a simple data structure from the Collections interface,
 and to add 2 or 3 photos and names to the app through the resource folder.
 The code should be submitted as a link to a Git repository, and the instructions also mention to use Git properly, document the code, and make sure 
 navigating back from an activity works correctly.
